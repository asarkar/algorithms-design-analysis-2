/*
 * In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for the all-pairs shortest-path problem.
 * The first line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively. Each subsequent line describes an edge
 * (the first two numbers are its tail and head, respectively) and its length (the third number).
 * NOTE: some of the edge lengths are negative.
 * NOTE: These graphs may or may not have negative-cost cycles.
 *
 * Your task is to compute the shortest shortest path. Precisely, you must first identify which, if any, of the three
 * graphs have no negative cycles. For each such graph, you should compute all-pairs shortest paths and remember the
 * smallest one (i.e., compute min{d(u,v)}, where d(u,v) denotes the shortest-path distance from u to v).
 *
 * If each of the three graphs has a negative-cost cycle, then enter "NULL" in the box below. If exactly one graph has
 * no negative-cost cycles, then enter the length of its shortest shortest path in the box below. If two or more of the
 * graphs have no negative-cost cycles, then enter the smallest of the lengths of their shortest shortest paths in the
 * box below.
 *
 * OPTIONAL: You can use whatever algorithm you like to solve this question. If you have extra time, try comparing
 * the performance of different all-pairs shortest-path algorithms!
 *
 * ANSWER: I implemented both Floyd-Warshall and Johnson's algorithms. FW takes O(n^3) time (evident from the three
 * for-loops). Johnson's takes O(mn log(n)), which is better than FW running time for sparse graphs (m = O(n)).
 * However, Johnson's algorithm requires mutating the input graph, which is not a good programming practice. My
 * implementation makes a mutable clone of the input graph, and performs all modifications on the clone. It also
 * uses a graph library that allows directly modifying the edge weight; most libraries don't.
 *
 * NOTE: If any of the shortest paths is negative, it's not necessary to run Johnson's algorithm in it's entirety for
 * the purpose of the assignment. We can simply return the minimum value in the array returned by the
 * Bellman-Ford algorithm. Let G' be the modified graph after adding the vertex s, d(u,v) <= 0 âˆ€ (u,v) in G'.
 * Since s is directly connected to both u and v, if there's an existing path p between u and v in G' s.t. length(p) > 0,
 * it is not the shortest path found by BF algorithm. In other words, running BF algorithm on the modified graph
 * upper bounds all shortest path lengths by zero, while preserving the negative path lengths.
 *
 * TODO:
 * 1. Copying the input graph incurs some overhead: profile the application to find out exactly how much.
 * 2. Both FW and Johnson's algorithms can be parallelized leading to quite good speedups.
