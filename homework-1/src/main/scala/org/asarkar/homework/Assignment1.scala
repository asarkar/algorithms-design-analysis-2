  /*
   * 1. In this programming problem and the next you'll code up the greedy algorithms from lecture for minimizing
   * the weighted sum of completion times.
   * Download the text file below.
   * This file describes a set of jobs with positive and integral weights and lengths. It has the format
   * [number_of_jobs]
   * [job_1_weight] [job_1_length]
   * [job_2_weight] [job_2_length]
   * ...
   * For example, the third line of the file is "74 59", indicating that the second job has weight 74 and length 59.
   * You should NOT assume that edge weights or lengths are distinct.
   * Your task in this problem is to run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs in decreasing order of the difference
   * (weight - length). Recall from lecture that this algorithm is not always optimal.
   * IMPORTANT: if two jobs have equal difference (weight - length), you should schedule the job with higher weight
   * first. Beware: if you break ties in a different way, you are likely to get the wrong answer.
   * You should report the sum of weighted completion times of the resulting schedule --- a positive integer ---
   * in the box below.
   *
   * 2. For this problem, use the same data set as in the previous problem.
   * Your task now is to run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs (optimally) in decreasing order of the ratio
   * (weight/length). In this algorithm, it does not matter how you break ties. You should report the sum of weighted
   * completion times of the resulting schedule --- a positive integer --- in the box below.
   *
   * ANSWER: We could use a min-heap, but inserting n items into a heap is at best O(n), and the operations
   * extract-min and decrease-key are O(log(n)) each, thus taking O(nlog(n)) time for n items.
   * Total time complexity = O(n) + O(nlog(n)).
   * Instead, we sort (O(nlog(n))) and then make one pass (O(n)); same asymptotic time complexity.

   * 3. In this programming problem you'll code up Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
   * Download the text file below.
   * This file describes an undirected graph with integer edge costs. It has the format
   * [number_of_nodes] [number_of_edges]
   * [one_node_of_edge_1] [other_node_of_edge_1] [edge_1_cost]
   * [one_node_of_edge_2] [other_node_of_edge_2] [edge_2_cost]
   * ...
   * For example, the third line of the file is "2 3 -8874", indicating that there is an edge connecting vertex #2
   * and vertex #3 that has cost -8874.
   * You should NOT assume that edge costs are positive, nor should you assume that they are distinct.
   * Your task is to run Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm on this graph. You should report the overall cost of
   * a minimum spanning tree --- an integer, which may or may not be negative --- in the box below.
   * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: This graph is small enough that the straightforward O(mn) time implementation of
   * Prim's algorithm should work fine. OPTIONAL: For those of you seeking an additional challenge, try implementing
   * a heap-based version. The simpler approach, which should already give you a healthy speed-up, is to maintain
   * relevant edges in a heap (with keys = edge costs). The superior approach stores the unprocessed vertices i
   * n the heap, as described in lecture. Note this requires a heap that supports deletions, and you'll probably
   * need to maintain some kind of mapping between vertices and their positions in the heap.
